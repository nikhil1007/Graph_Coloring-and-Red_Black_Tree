# Application of Graph coloring problem

This project aims at understanding the graph coloring problem and its applications. On a high-level below are the tasks involved:
<li> Read an input text file containing details about student and the courses they are currently enrolled.
<li> Build an undirected graph where each vertex represents a course and an edge between 2 nodes indicate they are being pursued simultaneously.
<li> Generate a final exam schedule where there is no conflict i.e. the students should be able to attend all the exams.
<li> A redblack tree is used as a dictionary while building the undirected graph
<li> The result is written to a text file named result.txt
